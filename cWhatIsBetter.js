// ==========
// Question:
// ==========

// 1. So how do we talk about and compare code in general terms without having to run performant operations to try to evaluate the efficiency 
// of our code?

// 2. What does better mean when refering to Big O Notation?
// Does it mean faster?
// Does it mean it takes up less memory?
// Does it mean itâ€™s more readable?
// Is it shorter in length as a solution?

// For time complexity we care more about how fast the code runs or how long it takes for code to execute and for space complexity we 
// care about memory or the number of operations used or created in an algorithm
