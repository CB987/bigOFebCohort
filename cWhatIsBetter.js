// Question:
// ==========

// 1. So how do we talk about and compare code in general terms without having to run performant operations to try to evaluate the efficiency 
// of our code?

// 2. What does better mean when refering to Big O Notation?
// Does it mean faster?
// Does it mean it takes up less memory?
// Does it mean it’s more readable?
// Is it shorter in length as a solution?

// For time complexity we care more about how fast the code runs or how long it takes for code to execute and for space complexity we 
// care about memory or the number of operations used or created in an algorithm

// 3. What is a good way of calculating our code if not timing functions?
// Rather than using timing functions which can vary from computer to computer we can count the number of simple operations is a given 
// algorithm as that remains constant regardless of what computer we are using. The time it takes for a task to execute will be directly 
// relative to the number of operations in an algorithm so it doesn’t matter what computer we are using or if it’s acting differently on a 
// given day. The time may vary or be different but again the time elapsed will based on the number of simple operations inside a given 
// algorithm.
